### Hello World 👋

My name is Clarice Bouwer and I absolutely 💖 Git, Clojure(Script), JavaScript and Google Firebase (among other things).

I write stuff that I share on [curiousprogrammer.dev](https://curiousprogrammer.dev) and on [dev.to](https://dev.to/cbillowes).

I am doing a Data Science bootcamp through Le Wagon. 
I am working on interactive cheat sheets for different Python packages. If you are interested, [check it out](https://github.com/cbillowes/cheat-sheets), star it, fork it, clone it, contribute to it, share it.
It's a work in progress project. From one package starting with numpy, I am hoping to grow it into numerous packages that make sense.
If you have any thoughts, suggestions or words of encouragement 😉, please let me know.
Made with ❤️ for Data Science 🔬 🧮 and Python 🐍
